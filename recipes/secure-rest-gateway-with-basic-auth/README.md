# Secured Microgateway using Basic Authentication Recipe

This is a recipe to secure the microgateway with basic authentication.

Instructions:

1) Place the rest-conditional-gateway.json in a folder and create the app using the command below:

```bash
mashling create -f rest-conditional-gateway.json gwWithBasicAuth
```

Note the setting:
```
"basicAuthFile": "${env.BASIC_AUTH_FILE}"
```

This is used to specify the environment variable to pass into the microgateway.

2) Start the microgateway with the BASIC_AUTH_FILE set to the full path to where your 
password file is located. The password file can be of the following form:

Plain (username:password):
```
foo:bar
tom:jerry
```

Hashed using SHA256 (username:salt:hashed)
```
foo:5VvmQnTXZ10wGZu_Gkjb8umfUPIOQTQ3p1YFadAWTl8=:6267beb3f851b7fee14011f6aa236556f35b186a6791b80b48341e990c367643
```

Start the microgateway:

```bash
BASIC_AUTH_FILE=/path/to/passwd.txt gwWithBasicAuth
```

3) Test basic authentication with:
```bash
curl -X GET http://foo:bar@localhost:9096/pets/3
```

A 403 is obtained when the wrong credentials are supplied:
```bash
curl -v -X GET http://foo:badpass@localhost:9096/pets/3

*   Trying ::1...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 9096 (#0)
